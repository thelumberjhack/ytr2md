# Youtube Transcripts 2 MarkDown

A Python CLI tool to format YouTube video transcripts to Markdown.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool uses the [youtube-transcript-api](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api) which implements
an unofficial YouTube API so this tool could break anytime. I am not guaranteeing that I will be on top of it unless
it impacts my workflow directly.

With that being said...
